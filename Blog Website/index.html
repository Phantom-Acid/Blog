            The 2024 Ford Mustang is almost here, and the configurator is now
            live. That means we can all visualize our dream and spend imaginary
            money building our perfect Mustang. The 2024 Mustang lineup runs
            from the sensible but still powerful EcoBoost model starting at
            $30,920 to the 500 horsepower track ready Dark Horse model starting
            at $59,270. Of course, sitting in the middle are the popular GT
            models that can be had in either fastback or convertible guise. And
            once you have your model picked out, your decisions are really just
            beginning. There are dozens of available options and thousands of
            combinations that will allow you to build a Mustang that stands
            apart from the rest. At just under 80 grand this is about as much
            money as you can spend on a 2024 Mustang. It is also the ultimate
            track day spec. We start with a Dark Horse Premium and its 500
            horsepower V8. We then pay $1,500 to paint it in Blue Ember
            Metallic. And since we are spending imaginary money, we tack on the
            painted racing stripe for $5,495. For $1,595 we add the 10-speed
            automatic transmission. Sorry folks, but for chasing lap times the
            auto is just plain faster. The Dark Horse Handling Package at $4,995
            is another must-have. It includes wider wheels and 305/30R19 tires
            up front and 315/30R19 tires out back. In addition, this package has
            magnetic dampers, larger rear spoiler with Gurney flap and revised
            chassis tuning. The last major option to tick is for the RECARO
            seats. Time to hit the track.
